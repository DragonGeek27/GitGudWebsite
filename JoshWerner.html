    <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Joshua Kelly Werner. I was born in the city of Boise, Idaho and was raised in the town of Meridian, Idaho. My K-12 years of school were tough. I did not fit in with any group and no one wanted me around. I was bullied consistently anywhere from being called names to being beaten up, and even being told to go kill myself. When I graduated from high school I was uncertain about what I wanted to do, so I attended CWI where I received an associates in liberal arts. During my final year at CWI, I heard about the new GIMM program at Boise State. The good thing about attending a Junior College is that I could take a wide variety of classes to help me find an area of interest. I have always loved drawing and creating things, so I felt like it would be a good fit for me. I am currently working towards my 4-year degree at Boise State with a major in GIMM.</p>
    <h1>Joy of Creating!</h1>
    <p>I love to create thing so art has always been enjoyable to me. I had nothing to do in my K-12 schooling years because lack of friends, but it was a great outlet as well. I have done all forms of art such as Drawing, Painting, Photography, and much more. I am always looking for new forms of art to attempt. Now it is on to game design because the idea of creating worlds sounds like a lot of fun and hard work.</p>
    <h1>Other Things I Enjoy.</h1>
    <p>As you can tell I love to create but I also have a plethora of hobbies other than art. I also enjoy things such as gaming and anime. I also love the outdoors. whenever I get a chance I go fishing & hunting. I also love animals. I love to play with my dog and gecko. I also enjoy cooking. Since I was little I have always been fascinated with medieval fantasy, especially dragons so they have influenced a lot of my art. even some of the people I game online with just call me "Dragon".</p>
